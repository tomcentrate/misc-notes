# Breaking into Software Engineering

Beware of Minutaie interviews, where they focus on a lot of the small ins and outs and other stuff...

Technical Interview is important, watch how they do things.

Get before the interview to show that you know what you're talking about...

* blogs
* Github, show this to the customer.

Experience in 

Networking / Making Relationships

* Talk with people and be friendly.

Don't make rookie mistakes.

* Be humble, good things will come, 
Launching Pad.

1. Gain experience early. 
2. Stick to your guns. Stay in the Software Engineering job if that's what you're into
3. Build profile.
4. Get resume online, Dice, Monster and all that.
5. Get formal and take interviewing process seriously. Set a calendar and get the interview process rolling.
6. Cramming for an interview or job skill is not taboo.
7. Gravitate towards the best at your 1st job.
8. Make a conscious decision on technology path...
9. MAke a conscious decision on company type.

# Hard Skills vs Soft Skills

## Hard Skills

* Languages
* Technologies
* Platform
* ARchitecture
* SDLC

## Soft Skills

* Professional interaction
* Leadership
* Communication
* Personal Habits
* Friendliness
* Communicate well, handle conflict, compromise. 

# Honing Hard Skills

## Evaluate your options

* Evaluate tech stacks, platforms, languages

* Choose a tech stack that's on an upclimb, 
* While declining technologies may pay more, it'd be tough.

## Hone a tech stack vs being a generalist.

* Jack of all trades is a double edged sword.
* Many tech companies perfer a deep vertical.


# Soft Skills

* Gravitates towards a mentor
* Learn from the wise and experienced
* Examine those that are successful 

Domain Knowledge.

Definitely important, hard to deal with

* Find a SME, and latch on if possible.
* ramp up aggressively.

Switch up Domain knowledge will burn and stuff.


# Continual Education

* You can't know it all,  (YCKIA)

# Career Progression

* 0-3 Years: grunt
* 3-6 Years: Mid
* 6-10 Years: Senior
* 10-15 years: Leadership


## Pay increases

Money does matter.

## Job Hopping

* Don't hop jobs too much, maybe. If i remember, Jumping within a year maybe looked down upon, once every few years, is 100% okay.

## job Security

## Benchmark yourself against the wider community.


# Fork in the Roadmap

* Natural progression to go into management in our field? No. 

* Great software enginesr != Great Managers
* Leade the code behind if you decide to go into management...
* Own your craft
* Conccentrate on Leadership
* If you don't like working with others, stay away from maangement.


Engineering Brands:

* 9 to 5 programmer - People that plateau early. avoid this? it will plateau
* The autopilot programmer - Does not aspire to grow and learn new things...
* The war wounds engineer - too much experience, afraid to change.
* The architecture astronaut. - ivory tower. please be more pragmatic.


Long Term decisions

* Find motivations

Contracting consulting FTE
Startup vs Corporate America

Find aspects to like.



Reasess happiness annually.
