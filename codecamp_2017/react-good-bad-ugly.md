React - Good Bad and Ugly

- ReactComponents need to be in PascalCase, camelCase doesn't work


the Bad

## Facebook

* Privacy issues and a sketchy license.
* History of pulling licensing in certain scenarios.

## Webpack and getting started overhead.

react-redux-boilerplate or react-create-app.

* webpack
* babel
* all necessary presets
* transforms

## State management.

State management is tough.


## Modeling Complex objects.

* Heavy emphasis on breaking things down. This is difficult.
* Recursively rerender objects
* 2 way binding is tough.


# The ugly

## JSX

* Tightly coupled view with logic.

## Clunky Addons

* Limited base app to lots of modules


webpack-react-redux
