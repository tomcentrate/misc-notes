* NewRelic Synthetics Notes
** Scripted Browser
*** Taking Katalon Recorder and using selectors to get different items.
We ran into some issues when it comes to getting selectors, and have to resort to using default XPATH selectors.
*** Some Selectors aren't supported.
- ValidateElementPresent and some other validatoins do not exist with the NewRelic translation layer.
