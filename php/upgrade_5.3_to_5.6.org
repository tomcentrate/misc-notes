Some Stupid things to do to get PHP 5.3.x Code to Run on atleast PHP 5.6.x

This is a list of things that you can do, but probably should not do to maintain projects
that are still on PHP 5.3.

I urge you to please re-examine your application and 'do the right thing', and fix up your apps.

Some of these things are not really THAT bad, but still pretty bad.


* Fixing or Re-enabling Globals

The option to enable globals have been disabled completely in PHP 5.4.
Use all the Superglobals ($_) instead. Access everything, like $_REQUEST['username'] and other goodies
through the superglobals

** The dirty hotfix:

Use the extract method to move all variables out of the Superglobals into your project.
Create a single file that gets included in all your files, like your autoloader, or a connection
file, and add lines that look like:

extract($_SERVER)
extract($_REQUEST)
extract($_FILES)
extract($_SESSION)

** Dirty Hotfix for $_FILES Superglobal:
This has some minor changes, originally
using the global version of a file uploaded, would add the temp file name to the $$filename

Example: 

Globals:
$document;
No Globals:
$_FILES['document'];

This has changed in some commands that take in a file path, since $document originally stored the path,

Globals:
Pre 5.3
copy($document, $new_location);

No Globals:
copy($document['tmp_name'], $new_location)

* session_register()

This one is pretty easy. Instead of using session_register($variable), you modify the Superglobal instead

PHP 5.3:
$username = 'user';
session_register($username);

PHP 5.4:
$_SESSION['username'] = 'user;
